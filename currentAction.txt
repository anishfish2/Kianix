I am playing Dark Souls 3. This is day 4 of me trying to beat the boss, Iudex Gundyr. I'm playing on 3x speed so I learn faster! My current moves and rewards per attempt are displayed while talking to my twitch chat. The connection is pretty bad from the future, so some of my actions and speech might be fuzzy!
